                        <p>
                            I&apos;m a BS Computer Science fresh graduate from the University of the Philippines - Baguio, who loves being able to build/develop tools and applications
                            that help businesses move faster and optimize their workflows.

                        <p>
                            I design and build the data backbone of modern applications. From database schema architecture to seamless integration with frameworks such as Next.js.
                            Having previous experience in PostgreSQL, Prisma, and data modeling, I focus on creating applications that have scalable, clean, and reliable data architecture.

                            You&apos;ll probably find me doing laps on any racing track, with my trusty controller,
                            or tinkering with electronics or software that spark my curiosity.
                            Maybe even deep in the rabbit hole of which computer games to play next.
